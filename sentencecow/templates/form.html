  <h1>Welcome to Sentence Cow!</h1>

  <p>This program extracts sentences from a text and counts the number of words
    in each sentence, <i>as best as possible.</i> Any string of alphanumeric
    characters that ends with a terminating punctuation mark such as . ! ? and
    the like is considered to be a sentence.</p>

  <p>Your text should be {{max}} words or less; {{char_max}} characters
     or less. I designed the program to parse texts written in English, but
     you're free to try texts written in other languages for kicks. </p>

  <p>Please note that abbreviations ending with a period sometimes cause
     false positives when detecting sentences. Conversely, citation numbers or
     symbols at the end of sentences may result in the last being ignored.
     If any of this happens, just use the tools on the Results page to split or
     merge the text accordingly.</p>

  <p>In the boxes below, write or paste a short text
     and set the maximum number of words that should appear in each sentence.
     Click 'Count' to see how your sentences measure up!</p>
