"""A module containing class necessary to implement functionality that will
check whether number of words in a sentence is below a certain threshold

To Do:

    * Write test code
    * Comment code properly
    * pylint/pycode style code
    * Clean up main
    * add attributes to module doc

Done:
    * implement for loop in sentences_more_than as while loop to get index
    * Figure out indent bug with triple quotes

Notes:
    * Merge sentences can't be done with long sentences (makes no sense);
    user needs to see all the sentences and select which ones to merge
