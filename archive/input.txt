The knob turned, but the door didn’t. Cedric pulled; nothing happened. He looked at his black, withered hand. How did he get so old? The room was bright white; so was the door. Its knob was made of glass.

Cedric sat down. It felt good to rest his back. An armrest supported his left arm. It was a fine bench. Its deep dark wood calmed him.

The room had no walls. When Cedric realized this, everything changed. He was now on a prairie. It was damp, green and rollicking. The sky was ashen. The bench had turned white; the door was now dark. It was still locked.

“I’ll never leave here,” Cedric thought.
